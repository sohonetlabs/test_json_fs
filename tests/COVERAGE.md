# Test Coverage Report

## Overall Coverage: 83% (346/417 lines)

### Well-Covered Areas (>90%)
- ✅ Helper functions (parse_size, humanize_bytes, unicode_to_named_entities) - 100%
- ✅ Path sanitization and caching - 100%
- ✅ File reading operations - 100%
- ✅ JSON validation in constructor - 100%
- ✅ Fill buffer generation - 100%
- ✅ Rate limiting logic - 100%
- ✅ IOP limiting logic - 100%
- ✅ Core FUSE operations (getattr, readdir, read) - 100%

### Partially Covered Areas (50-90%)
- ⚠️ Main function - Missing error paths and mount options
- ⚠️ Stats reporting thread - Thread execution not tested
- ⚠️ Some FUSE operations - Symlinks, extended attributes

### Not Covered (<50%)
- ❌ File logging (vs stdout logging)
- ❌ Actual FUSE mounting (requires integration tests)
- ❌ Some error conditions in main()

### Missing Line Details

1. **Logging Setup** (line 57)
   - File-based logging not tested (we use stdout)

2. **Stats Reporting Thread** (lines 219-220, 325-334)
   - Background thread execution
   - Would require sleep/timing in tests

3. **FUSE Operations** (various)
   - `opendir`, `releasedir`, `open`, `release` - Simple pass-through methods
   - `readlink` - Symlink operations (not supported)
   - `utimens` - Timestamp updates (no-op)
   - Extended attribute operations

4. **Main Function** (lines 776-810)
   - JSON validation error paths
   - Mount options setup
   - Actual FUSE mounting

### Recommendations

1. The 83% coverage is quite good for a filesystem project
2. Most uncovered code is either:
   - Error paths that are hard to trigger
   - Background threads requiring complex test setup
   - Actual FUSE mounting requiring system permissions
   
3. The core functionality is well-tested
4. Consider integration tests for actual mounting scenarios
